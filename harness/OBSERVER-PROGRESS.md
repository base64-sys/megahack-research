# Trace observer build progress

Backlog and evidence for the runtime half of `megahack.trace`. Instructions:
[OBSERVER-LOOP.md](OBSERVER-LOOP.md). Durable findings: [trace-observer.md](../notes/trace-observer.md).
The host-testable core this builds on: [trace-harness.md](../notes/trace-harness.md).

Status vocabulary: `pending`, `in progress`, `done`, `blocked`.

## Backlog

| id | item | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O1 | Discover the Geode 5.11.2 mod build path: SDK layout, exact command, produced artifacts, host toolchain | in progress |
| O2 | Observer skeleton: mod `megahack.trace`, links the portable core, writes meta + end to `runtime-traces/` | pending |
| O3 | Hook bridge: enter/exit events with call ids, depth and proven main-thread role | pending |
| O4 | Runner: hashes, one-target enforcement, sha256 sidecar, runtime511 selection, manifest feeding | pending |
| O5 | Pilot capture in runtime511 and a real `read_trace` pass (needs the user to launch) | pending |

## Evidence log

### Iteration 1 — O1, first half: the current SDK cannot build a mod

- Probed with a throwaway project in `%TEMP%` (not committed); every failure is recorded in
  [trace-observer.md](../notes/trace-observer.md) §What was tried.
- Established: `geode` CLI 3.9.0; `geode build` drives CMake + MSVC (VS 2022 BuildTools, cl
  14.44.35207, Windows SDK 10.0.26100); `geode new` is interactive-only; `GEODE_SDK` is the
  Geode **loader source** (5.11.2) and lacks the generated `Geode/Enums.hpp`, so no mod
  compiles against it; `cmake/Platform.cmake` cannot be included out of tree and
  `setup_geode_mod` needs a `geode-sdk` target the tree does not define.
- Next: install a real mod SDK with `geode sdk install <path>` into a dedicated directory and
  re-probe, pointing only the observer build at it. If the install is interactive, O1 becomes
  blocked on the user.
- Commit: `docs(observer): record the Geode 5.11.2 mod build path probe`.
